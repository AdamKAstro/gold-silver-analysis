Not a COLD audience

You mentioned that some Canadian-listed gold and silver stock tickers seem to be missing. The original list contained 66 companies, which covers many prominent players, but there are indeed hundreds more listed on the TSX and TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V). Due to context window limitations, I can’t include all 220+ TSX-listed and 970+ TSX-V-listed mining companies, but I’ve researched and expanded the list to include as many significant gold and silver stocks as possible.

i need you to improve my UI. The sliders dont work at sorting properly and or intuitively. So the ui needs a complete re-think. Maybe Relative importances (but never losing importance of all data)? also most of the stocks never get the stock price or market cap populated properly (usually fills as 1) so needs to be far more robust and reliable. 


Your current disclaimer is helpful, but you should strengthen it to explicitly state that the app does not provide investment advice, is not a substitute for professional advice, and that users assume all risks. Consult a Canadian lawyer to ensure it meets legal standards.
You may also need to limit liability in your terms of service, similar to Vercel’s approach (as noted in their Terms of Service), but tailored to your app’s context.

                    <th>Ticker Symbol</th>
                    <th>Stock Price (CAD)</th>

                    EV per Resource Oz ALL   The enterprise value (EV) of the company (in dollars) divided by the company's resources of all types of minerals (in gold equivalent ounces).
